# Colourfull Expressions Website

Test website for Colourfull Expressions, a subsidiary of Milminds Holdings.  
This project has been migrated from a static HTML/CSS setup into a modern [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and TypeScript for scalability, maintainability, and professional branding.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the homepage by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Notes
